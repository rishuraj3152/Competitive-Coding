			Minimum Characters required to make a String Palindromic

			You are given a string. The only operation allowed is to insert characters in the beginning of the string. How many minimum characters are needed to be inserted to make the string a palindrome string

Example:
Input: ABC
Output: 2
Input: AACECAAAA
Output: 2

*****SOLUTION*****
Try to learn about LPS array used in KMP string matching algorithm. Modify your string and compute its LPS array to derive the answer.
Each index of LPS array contains the longest prefix which is also a suffix. Now take the string and reverse of a string and combine them with a sentinal character in between them and compute the LPS array of this combined string. Now take the last value of the LPS array and subtract it with the length of the original string, This will give us the minimum number of insertions required in the begining of the string .

int Solution::solve(string A) {
    int n=A.length();
    if(n==0 || n==1)return 0;
    string temp=A;
    temp.push_back('+');
    for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
    {
        temp.push_back(A[i]);
    }
    vector<int> lps(2*n+1);
    lps[0]=0;
    int len=0;
    int i=1;
    while(i<(2*n+1))
    {
        if(temp[len]==temp[i])
        {
            len++;
            lps[i]=len;
            i++;
        }
        else
        {
            if(len>0)
                len=lps[len-1];
            else
            {
                lps[i]=0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    return (lps[2*n]-n)*(-1);
}
